/*
 The purpose of this exercise is to have an array of random indices remove the corresponding indices of a mutable array WITHOUT affecting the original order of the mutable array's elements.
 
 Example Application:
    Quiz game.
    Game selects questions from mutable array of questions via randomly chosen index
    numbers. The random indices are stored in another mutable array.  If the player closes
    the app then reopens to continue play, the array of indices can be used to remove the
    same used questions from the array of questions so that the user is not asked the same
    question again.
